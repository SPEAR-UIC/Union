Require language version "1.5".

# Parse the command line.
numwords is "Message size (words)" and comes from "--msgsize" or "-s" with default 14413K.
reps is "Number of repetitions" and comes from "--reps" or "-r" with default 100.
computetime is "Computation time (ms)" and comes from "--compute" or "-c" with default 129.

# Allocate a send buffer and a receive buffer.
Task 0 multicasts a numwords*num_tasks word message from buffer 0 to all other tasks.
Task 0 multicasts a numwords*num_tasks word message from buffer 1 to all other tasks.

# Measure the performance of CODES_MPI_Allreduce().
Task 0 resets its counters then

} then
task 0 logs elapsed_usecs/1000 as "Elapse time (ms)".
